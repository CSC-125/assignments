Assignment 2 - Due Friday, September 28 by 2:00 pm


Write a class SavingsAccount that is similar to the BankAccount class, except that it has an added instance variable interest. Supply a constructor that sets both the initial balance and the interest rate. Supply a method addInterest (with no explicit parameter) that adds interest to the account. Write a SavingsAccountTester class that constructs a savings account with an initial balance of $1000 and an interest rate of 10 percent. Then apply the addInterest method and print the resulting balance. Also compute the expected result by hand and print it.
Implement a class Student. For the purpose of this exercise, a student has a name and a total quiz score. Supply an appropriate constructor and methods getName(), addQuiz(int score), getTotalScore(), and getAverageScore(). To compute the average, you also need to store the number of quizzes that the student took. Supply a StudentTester class that tests all methods.
Write a program that draws a picture of a house. It could be as simple as the accompanying figure, or if you like, more elaborate (3-D, skyscraper, marble columns in the entryway, whatever). Implement a class House and supply a method draw(Graphics2D g2) that draws the house.
